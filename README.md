# DependencyUserLib

This lib uses the lib [Dependency](https://github.com/djavan-bertrand/Dependency).
It provides through the class DependencyInfo information about the Dependency lib.

This library is a exemple to illustrate the fact that we should:

- be very carefully about dependencies used when developping an SDK or a lib.
- don't break API compatibility

See [DependencyUserApp](https://github.com/djavan-bertrand/DependencyUserApp) README to know more.
